# Irys Bundler SDK

The Irys Bundler SDK is a typesafe SDK for uploading data to the Irys network. 

## What is Irys?

Irys is the first L1 programmable datachain, designed to optimize data storage and execution. By combining storage and execution, it significantly increases the usefulness of blockspace, enabling a wider range of web services to come onchain that aren’t possible right now.

Irys empowers developers to create and innovate like never before. With Irys, builders can eliminate dependencies, integrate efficient onchain data, and unlock new possibilities for dynamic, real-time applications—all within a unified platform.

> This SDK is for uploading data only. 

## Irys SDK Quickstart

### Installing

Install using npm:

```console
npm install @irys-network/bundler-client
```

>If you get a warning saying `bigint: Failed to load bindings, pure JS will be used (try npm run rebuild?)` during install, it can be safely ignored.
